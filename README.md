# Transfer-learning-Garbage-Classification
Building deep learning models can be very computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when training from scratch. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models on large datasets and fine-tune them for our specific tasks. In this project, I demonstrate how transfer learning can be used to classify garbage into different categories, using the MobileNetV2 model.

## Before we start with the project... what is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where knowledge acquired from one task is reused to improve performance on another task. By using a model like MobileNetV2, trained on a large, general dataset, we can fine-tune it for a similar, specific task. This approach saves time, computational resources, and data requirements while achieving high accuracy

If we use a classification model trained on images of dogs and cats, we can transfer its knowledge to a new model that's trained on images of rabbits and deer. The pre-trained model has learned to recognize basic features (like edges, textures, and shapes) that are common across various objects. This is where the power of transfer learning comes in, especially when the new dataset (rabbits and deer) is smaller or lacks enough data to train a deep model from scratch.

Freezing Layers
The early layers of a neural network learn general features such as edges and textures that are useful across many different tasks. These layers are typically frozen during transfer learning. Freezing means we prevent the weights in these layers from being updated during training. The idea behind freezing these layers is that they have already learned generic, fundamental features (like edges, corners, and simple patterns) that apply to almost any image!

Fine-Tuning Layers
The deeper layers, which capture more abstract and complex features, are more specific to the task at hand (for example, recognizing the difference between a dog and a cat). These layers are where the model learns what makes each class distinct, such as the shape of the ears or the color patterns. Fine-tuning involves unfreezing some of these deeper layers and allowing them to adjust during training. The deeper layers will adapt to the new task (recognizing rabbits and deer), making the model more specialized to the new dataset.

The Final Layer
The final layer of the pre-trained model is specific to the original task (predicting dog or cat labels). When transferring the model to a new task, these final layers are replaced with a new set of layers that output predictions for the new classes (rabbits and deer). This allows the model to make predictions in the context of the new dataset.
